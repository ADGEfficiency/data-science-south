## Why Learn about Career Materials?

## What are Career Materials?

**Career materials are content that you to create & maintain to succeed in your career**.  This content will be shared with others, and can represent you both privately and publicly.

**All your career materials should be cleanly and consistently formatted, without spelling or grammatical errors**.

## Looking for Roles

Favour a concentrated, deep approach over a wide, shallow net.  You only need to find one job!

**In the best case, your career materials will reflect the job requirements of your desired role**.  

## CV 

**A CV (Curriculum Vitae) summarizes your education, work experience, and skills**. 

It's likely that everyone involved in your job application process will look at your CV - it's the most important career document.

You should share your CV as a PDF document, and it should be one or two pages long.

## CV Length is Important

Space on your CV is valuable - it represents time that someone needs to spend understanding your CV.  The more you can focus on important, relevant skills, the better your CV will be.

## Structuring Your CV

### Header

The first part of your CV should be a header that contains:

- your name,
- your location (usually just a city),
- links to your LinkedIn, Github and email,

Whether you need to include a picture or not depends on the market - most likely you don't need a picture on your CV.

### Summary

**Your CV should start with a one to three sentence summary**.

Your summary can focus on your experience, your skills or your professional mission.

```text
fn:summary
Data {analyst | scientist | engineer} with {n} years of experience in {industry}.
Proven ability to {skill}. 
Passionate about {industry | topic}.
```

### Work Experience

**Your work experience should be based on stories** - action focused, using phrases like:

- responsible for,
- lead team,
- introduced ideas, concepts or new ways of working,
- built, developed or constructed,
- made or saved money.

```text
fn:experience
{job title} at {company} from {date} to {date}
- {action focused achievement},
- {action focused achievement}.
```

### Education

**Your education section lists relevant education at universities or bootcamps**. 

You can also consider adding online courses or certifications.

How much you include here depends on your level.  If you are early on in your career, you might include a relevant list of courses for your degrees.  

For those with a decade of experience, they may only include the degree title, preferring to use the space on their experience.

```text
fn:experience
{degree} at {university} from {date} to {date}
- {action focused achievement},
- {action focused achievement}.
```

### Skills & Projects

**Skills and projects are optional sections**.

Skills should be tailored the position, and match what they ask for in the job advertisement.

While a list of skills may be good for word recognition, it is too easy to lie on skill lists. So much that they are often ignored.  Stories however, are much harder to fabricate.  Be specific!

If you do include a skill on your CV, be prepared to be asked questions about in during interviews.

## Cover Letter

**A cover letter provides a more detailed explanation of why you are a good fit for the job**. 

A cover letter is a one page personalised note to support your job application. Like your CV it should be targeted, tailored and personalised.  It should be formatted consistently with your CV.  Your cover letter should be one page - between five to eight paragraphs. Ideally it is addressed to specific person.

**The goal of a cover letter is expand on your CV - not to repeat it**. A cover letter lets you expand on things like your current availability, a story of your recent successes or examples of benefit you can bring to a role.

A example cover letter structure:

```text
fn:cover-letter
To {whom it may concern | $NAME},

I am writing to apply for the {POSITION} role at {COMPANY}, as advertised on {WHEREYOUFOUNDIT}

First paragraph:
- be clear about which position you are applying for and how you found it,
- outline why you are applying,
- your main experience.

Middle section (second, third and/or fourth paragraphs):
- how your skills and experience match the job,
- what bring to the role (show skill alignment), suitable skills
- key achievements, background on what makes you relevant,
- why you want to work there,
- each paragraph can be one story.

Ending - one of:
- I look forward to hearing from you to discuss this role further,
- Kind regards,
- Your sincerly,
- Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you,
```

## LinkedIn

**LinkedIn is a professional social media website**. It allows you to showcase your skills, experience, and qualifications. It also allows you to connect with other professionals in your field and get an idea of the kind of job opportunities that are available. 

For better or worse, LinkedIn is currently the leading professional social media website. You don't need to be a [LinkedIn influencer](https://www.reddit.com/r/LinkedInLunatics/) - but you should keep your profile updated and professional.

Your LinkedIn profile is most similar to your CV - both can have the same content.  A LinkedIn profile has no restriction on length - think of it as an expanded, public version of your CV.

## GitHub

**GitHub is a platform where developers can share code**. It gives an employer a sense of your skills and experience in programming, and can help you to stand out in a crowded job market.

A GitHub profile has many false negatives - many good developers have no GitHub, with their best work being done in private & on the job.
